          Another woodland bird, the Pygmy Nuthatch, lives in pine forests in
          the western United States. A small gray passerine songbird with a
          short tail, it’s known for its squeaky chirp and quick movements. The
          Pygmy Nuthatch eats pine nuts and some insects, including leaf beetles
          and weevils. It lives in pine forests, preferring to nest in larger,
          older trees. A highly social species, this bird has been known to
          roost in large groups. In some cases, more than 150 birds have been
          found sleeping together in a single tree. Construction, wildfires and
          drought increasingly threaten this bird’s habitat.
